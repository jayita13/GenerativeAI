In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. \n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \ntools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app \npurchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  \nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal \nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of \nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024 . We have made estimates and assumptions \nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual \nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in \nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form \n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023  filed with the SEC.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update \n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands \nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about \nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for \ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential \neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax \nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation \nand income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early \nadoption permitted.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services \nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for \nthese commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when \nour customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over \nthe next 24 months  with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred \nrevenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with \nan original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, \nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google \nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices.

Non-marketable equity securities \nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or \nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy . Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment \nare classified within Level 3 .

The primary risk \nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, \nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate \nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance \ninvestment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the \nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy \ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at \ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These \ncontracts have maturities of 24 months  or les s.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points \nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life \nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and \nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of March 31, 2024 , the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect \nwas $128 million , which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in \nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the \nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize \nchanges in the excluded  component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of \nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude \nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in \nOI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and \nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into \nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising \nfrom other derivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of OI&E.

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of \noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. \nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to \nus. As of December 31, 2023  and March 31, 2024 , assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs \nwere $4.9 billion  and $4.1 billion , respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs \nwere $2.5 billion  and $2.2 billion , respectively.  We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are \nincluded within Other Bets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion  and $3.2 billion  as of \nDecember 31, 2023  and March 31, 2024 , respectively, of which $1.1 billion  and $1.0 billion  is redeemable \nnoncontrolling interest (RNCI) as of December 31, 2023  and March 31, 2024 , respectively . NCI and RNCI are \nincluded within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for an y \nperiod presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6  for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private \ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve \npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that \nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results \nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We \naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the \ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these \nunconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion  and $4.0 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2023  and $6.9 billion  and \n$5.3 billion , respectively, as of March 31, 2024 . The difference  between the maximum exposure and the carrying \nvalue relates primarily to future funding commitments.\nNote 5.    Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to  $10.0 billion  through the issuance of commercial paper. Net \nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had  no commercial paper outstanding  as \nof December 31, 2023  and March 31, 2024 . \nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n19", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3604, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06fa852d-afa1-4710-8471-390ea7224e76": {"__data__": {"id_": "06fa852d-afa1-4710-8471-390ea7224e76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "486ae2d9-5950-4276-b6b7-7f06ef61a5d9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "hash": "2770e6e111558ecb9e32418be4335ad6ec445836dd756f3d2524918f69c342c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Long-Term Debt\n Total outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages):\nMaturity Coupon RateEffective Interest \nRateAs of \nDecember 31, \n2023As of\nMarch 31, \n2024\nDebt\n2016-2020 Notes issuances 2025 - 2060 0.45%  - 2.25% 0.57%  - 2.33% $ 13,000 $ 12,000 \nFuture finance lease payments, net \nand other (1) 1,746  1,672 \n      Total debt  14,746  13,672 \nUnamortized discount and debt \nissuance costs  (130)  (127) \nLess: Current portion of long-term \nnotes(2) (1,000)  0 \nLess: Current portion of future \nfinance lease payments, net and \nother current debt(1)(2) (363)  (317) \n       Total long-term debt $ 13,253 $ 13,228 \n(1)Future finance lease payments are net of imputed interest.\n(2)Total current portion of long-term debt is included within other accrued expenses and current liabilities.

We have \nagreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or \ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these \nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In \naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain \nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification \nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the \npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of \noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification cl aims arise in the \nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of \noperations or cash flows in a particular period. \nAs of March 31, 2024 , we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably \npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be \nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be \nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could \naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible \nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial \nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to \ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and \nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal \nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in \naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Matters\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various \nantitrust-related complaints against us.\n\u2022On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display \nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law.

On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC \ndecision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring \nshopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion  for the fine in \nthe second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we \nsubsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\n\u2022On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related \ndistribution agreements infringed European competition law.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas  \nWe report  our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, \nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees \nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, \nand NFL Sunday Ticket , as well as Google One;  the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n\u2022Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for \nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and \nsubscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and \ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues \nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.  \nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering \nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the \nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are \nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation  and impairment , are \nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs \nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate \ninitiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and \nlegal costs, including certain fines and settlements.  Charges associated with employee severance and office space \nreductions  during 2023  and employee severance in the first quarter of 2024 , were not allocated to our segments.  \nAdditionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\n27", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3800, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4cb3d55-87c1-4ea3-a1b7-4b61cb4b1951": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4cb3d55-87c1-4ea3-a1b7-4b61cb4b1951", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0ee094be-4c68-45a4-be9a-1ee4cb3a9cdc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "hash": "0877f34c0229eb4cbf0f1688f346386abd559db3357325eb3ef14c621d8f91c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The following table presents information about our segments (in millions):\n Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n 2023 2024\nRevenues:\nGoogle Services $ 61,961 $ 70,398 \nGoogle Cloud  7,454  9,574 \nOther Bets  288  495 \nHedging gains (losses)  84  72 \nTotal revenues $ 69,787 $ 80,539 \n Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n 2023 2024\nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services $ 21,737 $ 27,897 \nGoogle Cloud  191  900 \nOther Bets  (1,225)  (1,020) \nAlphabet-level activities  (3,288)  (2,305) \nTotal income from operations $ 17,415 $ 25,472 \nSee Note 2  for information relating to revenues by geography.\nThe following table presents long-lived assets by geographic area, which includes property and equipment, net \nand operating lease assets (in millions) :\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2023As of\nMarch 31, 2024\nLong-lived assets:\nUnited States $ 110,053 $ 117,085 \nInternational  38,383  39,865 \nTotal long-lived assets $ 148,436 $ 156,950 \n28", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 919, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59923964-c9ab-4e97-b916-8b7cdcc85575": {"__data__": {"id_": "59923964-c9ab-4e97-b916-8b7cdcc85575", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0b98c18-c34f-493c-bab9-5dfdc57e5e67", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "hash": "427241e30df7b104c7c1f1625ed9ae9abf1e40f9930ea7db861c9dedcc8ea7b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ITEM 2.

Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment \nmanufacturers, and software developers; and\n\u25e6amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\u2022Other cost of revenues primarily includes:\n\u25e6compensation expense related to our data centers and other operations  such as content review and \ncustomer and product support;\n\u25e6content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video \nand other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content \nproviders based on revenues generated or a flat fee);\n\u25e6depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\n\u25e6inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly \nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, \nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our \nGoogle Network partners .\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as \neither R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\nThe main  components of our R&D expenses are:\n\u2022compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our \nexisting  and new products and services; \n\u2022depreciation; and\n\u2022third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our \nengineering and product development efforts.\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n\u2022compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain \ncustomer service functions ; and\n\u2022spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n\u2022compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and \nother administrative support functions; \n\u2022expenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and \n\u2022third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative \nservices.\n31", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3217, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "487db1f7-1325-4ee9-8841-0321af3c1ff0": {"__data__": {"id_": "487db1f7-1325-4ee9-8841-0321af3c1ff0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a4b913ee-d035-45a5-a5a2-e38be86a081b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "hash": "c5314b2266ec94be536ebb8ad380f7336e573394548fb977674ef2ed69b14b8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Other Income (Expense), Net \nOI&E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense),  the effect of foreign currency exchange gains \n(losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, \nand income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.\nFor additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations \nin the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, \nItem 8 and Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosur es About Market Risk\u201d in our An nual Report on Form 10-\nK for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023  as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nincluded in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nProvision for Income Taxes  \nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes \nincurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate.

We also \nhave long-term taxes payable of $7.1 billion  primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2024 . \nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\nAs of March 31, 2024 , we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $44.0 \nbillion , of which $29.4 billion  was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain \ntechnical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements \nrelated to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses , inventory and network capacity. For those \nagreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities \nand/or pricing as of March 31, 2024 . In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change \nbased on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content \nlicenses, see Note 8  of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report \non Form 10-Q. \nIn addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and \nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar \ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated \nand are not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nSee Part II, Item 7, \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023 . \n41", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4041, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44c628b6-937f-4039-9b6b-5bb8924d7a9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "44c628b6-937f-4039-9b6b-5bb8924d7a9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e01aec0-1135-40d6-b845-c32de3c9d5cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "hash": "0b01b827aa9fed5bf12b5bea4112c9601e669e27aabb0b8945d51de6e8fdf468", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Available Information\nOur website is located at www.abc.xyz , and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor . \nAccess to our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and \nour Proxy Statements,  and any amendments to these reports, is available on our investor relations website, free of \ncharge, after we file or furnish them with the SEC and they are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .\nWe webcast via our investor relations website our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host \nwith members of the investment community.

OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 8  \u201cCommitments and Contingencies  - \nLegal Matters\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report \non Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     \nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in \nPart I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , which \ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of \nour stock. Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023.\nRisks Specific to our Company\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, \na loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to \ncustomize ads could harm our business. \nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more \nvalue (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more \neffective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy \npractices, such as our initiatives to phase out third-party cookies (which remain subject to review, affecting the \ntiming), as well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may \nin the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that \nmake customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online \nservices have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-\nparty digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively \ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \noperating results. \nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock \nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously \nactive or fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or \ndividends could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with \nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date \nand does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of \nshares. In April 2024, we announced the approval of a cash dividend to our Class A, Class B and Class C \nstockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors at their sole \ndiscretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the \nDelaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require,  and our Board of Directors may \nnot declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of Directors to declare a dividend in any \nspecific dollar amount per share. Further, our share repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices, \nincrease their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may \nresult in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile. \nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In \naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have \nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, including, among others, the size or \ncontinuity of either our share repurchase or dividend programs, the activities of our peers and changes in broader \n43", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4879, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78ec76a4-f3c1-41b3-84d5-5b3bc92fbfce": {"__data__": {"id_": "78ec76a4-f3c1-41b3-84d5-5b3bc92fbfce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "64851777-688c-44bb-83cd-2c14b9d3911c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "hash": "58823406d89d350e0eda4feedaad97d81b1c9042d5b78fc8f941e5acdbf7ab92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "economic and political conditions around the world.

OTHER INFORMATION \n10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024 , no Section 16 director or officer adopted , modified, or \nterminated  a \u201cRule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\u201d  (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act).\nThere were no \u201cnon-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements\u201d (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the \nExchange Act) adopted, modified or terminated  during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024  by our directors and \nSection 16 officers. \nCompensatory Arrangements of Certain Officer s\nOn April 16, 2024, the Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee of the Board of \nDirectors of Alphabet approved the accrual of dividend equivalent units to holders of all unvested stock units, \nsubject to the approval of a dividend declaration by the Board of Directors of the Company (which was approved \nand announced on April 25, 2024). This approval covers both performance stock unit awards and Google stock unit \nawards, and applies both to currently outstanding and future equity awards. For the avoidance of doubt, the \ncorresponding amendments to the respective stock unit grant agreements will apply both to currently outstanding \ngrant agreements and all future grant agreements. As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus \nwould not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of \ndividend equivalent units is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the Company when the \nstock units were granted and to treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.\n44", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3348, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17baa2bf-7111-4543-b83e-c2860e8f46f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "17baa2bf-7111-4543-b83e-c2860e8f46f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "15e088ef-592c-4338-94a1-f5b9ac3422bb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_path": "data\\goog-10-q-q1-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 517713, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "hash": "d326b52bc8f8b89552f041cb590b9609d1c042dc1cc46decf12a3b22a68351c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ITEM 6.
