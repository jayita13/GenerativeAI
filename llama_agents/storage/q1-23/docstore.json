In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. \n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received \nfor subscription-based products.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  \nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal \nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of \nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023 . We have made estimates and assumptions \nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual \nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in \nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form \n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022  filed with the SEC.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and \nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years  to six years  and the estimated useful life of certain \nnetwork equipment from five years  to six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal \nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 202 2, and \nthose placed in service during the quarter ended March 31, 2023 , the effect of this change in estimate was a \nreduction in depreciation expense of $988 million  and an increase in net income of $770 million , or $0.06  per basic \nand $0.06  per diluted share , for the three months ended March 31, 2023 . \nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d)\nOn July 15, 2022, we executed a 20-for-one stock split of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All prior \nperiod references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and \napplicable disclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock \nSplit.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n10", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3356, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85067a83-6348-4381-bc4a-96b30beab8f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "85067a83-6348-4381-bc4a-96b30beab8f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "GOOG-10-Q-Q1-2023.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GOOG-10-Q-Q1-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533587, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d26de3c4-f59d-4623-813c-79968858fe34", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "GOOG-10-Q-Q1-2023.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GOOG-10-Q-Q1-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533587, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "hash": "8f3fbe13fde028356882b29c09b23d2058cce1590f6ea1a16509fa76ec613898", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Note 2.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services \nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these \ncommitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our \ncustomers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize \nsuch as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 \nmonths  with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue \ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original \nexpected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, \nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.  \nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022  was $4.5 billion , of which $1.6 billion  was recognized as revenues \nduring the three months ended March 31, 2023 .Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n11", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2405, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9890635-29f5-418d-b5af-d19117e0d30a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9890635-29f5-418d-b5af-d19117e0d30a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "GOOG-10-Q-Q1-2023.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GOOG-10-Q-Q1-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533587, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "833d478e-66d9-4eab-b014-67e1c16c7922", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "GOOG-10-Q-Q1-2023.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GOOG-10-Q-Q1-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533587, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "hash": "adbb7ea3922a5dd892b976f37cbcbd4fbbffbf91466b68cc92784596ac69d53c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Note 3.

We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance \ninvestment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the \nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy \ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at \ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have \nmaturities of 24 months  or les s.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points \nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life \nof the hedging instrument in revenues.

Fair value hedge amounts included in \nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting \ngains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge \neffectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of \nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude \nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in \nother income (expense), net.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \nhedges are primarily recorded in other income (expense), net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on \nmonetary assets and liabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns.

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)  \nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of \noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. \nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to \nus. As of December 31, 2022  and March 31, 2023 , assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs \nwere $4.1 billion  and $3.2 billion , respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs \nwere $2.6 billion  and $2.5 billion , respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are \nincluded within Other Bets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion  and $3.7 billion  as of \nDecember 31, 2022  and March 31, 2023 , respectively, of which $1.1 billion  is redeemable noncontrolling interest \n(RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to \nnoncontrolling interests was not material for an y period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of \nOI&E. See Note 6  for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private \ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve \npower generation using renewable sources. \nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that \nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results \nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We \naccount for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\n The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the \ninvestments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to \nthese VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated \nVIEs were $2.7 billion  and $2.8 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2022  and $2.6 billion  and $2.7 billion , \nrespectively, as of March 31, 2023 .\nNote 5.

In \naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain \nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification \nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the \npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of \noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the \nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of \noperations or cash flows in a particular period. \nAs of March 31, 2023 , we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably \npossible.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n24", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2935, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1aea8ab9-f895-47ce-acea-ef9856ec4690": {"__data__": {"id_": "1aea8ab9-f895-47ce-acea-ef9856ec4690", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "GOOG-10-Q-Q1-2023.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GOOG-10-Q-Q1-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533587, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "88fb5c54-3bd2-43ff-8cce-0cdf2d1e972c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "GOOG-10-Q-Q1-2023.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GOOG-10-Q-Q1-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 533587, "creation_date": "2024-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-13"}, "hash": "be5c77e597ecf19fe13ee54cb1e0d7d8406a358988ba828a8a17991ad1f4922c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1f9ab07b-21e3-4fa6-8892-1f18e71222c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "90ee5f9c751486c8674fc04423496f32fbd2cb4fa8fa6006a03924ef5eb6f522", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Legal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be \nreasonably estimated.

We continue to cooperate \nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that \ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in \nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or \norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have \nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss \nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has \nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC \naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important \nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing \nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such \nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In \naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a \nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent \norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and \nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently \nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions.  We also periodically have \ndata incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and \ngovernment investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties, \ninjunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to \nour business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of \nwhich could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding \npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including \nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. \nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied \nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We \naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax \nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.

We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate \nmovements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level.
